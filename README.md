[Description:] Toggle Notifications allows players to disable or enable various Notificiations within Kerbal Space Program 2. In the current 0.2.2 build players now have access to a GUI which will allow them to select which notifications they want enabled or disabled. Currently once you enable a Notification, you cannot disable it. You'll have to save, and relaunch to reset the Notification. This build only allows the user to disable the Game Pause Notification.

**Fixed pathing issues with the various patches.
**Implemented Harmony Transpilers instead of Harmony Prefixes
**Simple GUI that is accessed from the Appbar Menu or by pressing Right Alt + P.
**Improved performance by changing how the mod renders the GUI

                                         [CKAN] 
 Make sure you've updated CKAN to the current release. If you don't have CKAN installed, go here: https://github.com/KSP-CKAN/CKAN/releases Install CKAN and make sure you have KSP2 as the game instance. You'll see the option to click on Toggle Notifications. Apply changes.
If you already have CKAN installed, here's how you get it for KSP 2:

1. Select File (Top Left) > Select Manage Game Instances
2. A new Window pops up called Manage Game Instance Select "New Game Instance" (Bottom Right)
3. Add instance to CKAN
4. C:/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Kerbal Space Program 2/KSP2_x62.exe
5. Click Open
6. It returns to Manage Game Instance. You'll see both Game Instance. One for KSP1 
   and one for KSP2. Select the KSP2 one by click on it. It will highlight which 
   one you've selected. Then go to bottom right, and click select. Now you have 
   CKAN for KSP2
